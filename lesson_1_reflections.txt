Through the use of one command I was able to determine easily where the 
two files differ from each other even if the code is very long and it 
will take a long time if I manually find their differences. This will 
be useful in the future. I think that by having an easy access to the 
entire history of a file I will be able to see what changes I made and 
be able to compare the previous ones to the current ones. I would be 
able to track the changes. Some of the version-control systems are 
truly helpful in situations where the computer suddenly turns off and
 the system will be able to bring it back like the way it used to be. 
 And through the use of such systems any programmer will be stress-free 
 in manually saving and organizing the version of their files. 
 The pros of manually choosing when to create a commit makes it more 
 easy to understand and to see the change because it is narrowed down 
 into a more specific way. It lets all the participants in the group
 know the specific changes which make the project easire to finish. 
 I think Git allows saving of multiple files in one commit to be able to
 have a complete set whether only one file was changed. There are times 
 that the when programmer forgot to save the file that he changed 
 awhile ago because he/she jumped to another file that he wants to 
 change so saving of multiple files in one commit is a great advantage.
 The commands git log and git diff are very useful in comparing 2 files
 and can be extremely helpful in letting partners every change you made in the program.
